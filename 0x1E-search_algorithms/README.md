# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
In this directory, we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand the concept of searching algorythhms and help us to answer the next questions:
-   What is a search algorithm
-   What is a linear search
-   What is a binary search
-   What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Files
 - 0-linear.c is a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the [Linear search algorithm](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/60Mr-aRkqqgLCHEF9HZ64A "Linear search algorithm")
 - 1-binary.c is a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the [Binary search algorithm](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/WyWx1D9mcUcAwpEA2ifkeQ "Binary search algorithm")
 - 2-O What is the `time complexity` (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size `n`?
 - 3-O What is the `space complexity` (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size `n`?
 - 4-O What is the `time complexity` (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size `n`?
 - 5-O What is the `space complexity` (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size `n`?
 - 6-O What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
