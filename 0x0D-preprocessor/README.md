-What are macros and how to use them
-What are the most common predefined macros

In this directory we will find a number of files that help us to understand the
uses of macros and headers in a programming language as C.

0-object_like_macro.h is a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an
abbreviation for the token 1024

1-pi.h is a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the
token 3.14159265359.

2-main.c is a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from,
followed by a new line.

3-function_like_macro.h is a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the
absolute value of a number x.

4-sum.h is a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers
